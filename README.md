# Description: Feel free to register first or use the below credentials for this project, especially for anime lovers.

### You need not to worry about anything, just register yourself and boom, you will enter the world of anime where you can find many things.
### I have used an open and free API to fetch the data in JSON format, and this web application is fully dependent on the API calls.
# There are many routes used in making this Flask-Based Web Application Project.
## Api Used This project includes:
### 1) https://api.waifu.pics/sfw/ 
### 2) https://animechan.vercel.app/api/quotes
### 3) https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime/
### 4) https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime
### 5) https://kitsu.io/api/edge/manga

# Special thanks to David Malan's [CS-50] lectures, which helped me to understand the basics of Flask-Based Web Applications.
### You can get random anime quotes, slap gifs, hug gifs, and dance gifs so you don't get tired of seeing the same image over and over.

- Use your Gmail to register first and then operate the functionality of this project.
- You can't access any page other than signup and login without logging in. 
- Please make sure that you provide Gmail only (because it might show an error 500 page on signup though your email is added in the database but you might end up with an error 500 page).
- Please be patient if loading takes a bit of time because there might be load on the api being requested or it may happen that the api link doesn't work, but in that case, please read the message coming in the message section or refresh the browser.
- All details are coming from the API itself, so there might be a possibility that some details are missing.
